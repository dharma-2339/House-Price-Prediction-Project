# House-Price-Prediction-Project

##Overview

This repository contains a Machine Learning project aimed at predicting house prices in Bangalore city. We have employed Linear Regression, a fundamental algorithm in regression analysis, to estimate the prices of houses based on various features such as size, area, location, availability, number of bathrooms, balconies, and more. This project takes you through the entire data science workflow, from data cleaning and exploration to feature engineering and model building.

##Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project is to provide a predictive model for estimating house prices in Bangalore. Accurate price predictions can assist both homebuyers and sellers in making informed decisions. By utilizing machine learning techniques, we aim to capture patterns and relationships within the dataset to make accurate price estimates.

##Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle and consists of various features related to houses in Bangalore. Key columns in the dataset include size, area, price, availability, location, number of bathrooms, balconies, and more.

##Data Preprocessing

The dataset undergoes thorough data preprocessing, including:
 1.Handling missing values
 2.Cleaning and formatting data
 3.Removing outliers
 4.Encoding Categorical variables

##Feature Engineering

Feature engineering plays a crucial role in improving model performance. We create new features or transform existing ones to extract meaningful information from the data. This step enhances the model's ability to capture relevant patterns.

##Linear Regression

Linear Regression is the core algorithm used for predicting house prices. This simple yet powerful technique models the relationship between independent variables (features) and the target variable (house prices) by fitting a linear equation to the data. We evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

##Results

The project's notebooks and source code provide insights into the model's performance, including evaluation metrics and visualizations. It showcases how well the Linear Regression model predicts house prices based on the selected features.
